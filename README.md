## How to initiate the project

### Front
Go into /tender-front
First you will need to install the node package management run
the following code line on your directory terminal `npm install`.

### Back
Go into /tender-back
Initiating the back by opening the tender back repository and download the Laravell

Create a postgresql 
Create a file call .env (copy by .env.example and edit it)
Into .env set the pgsql information and stmp for email.

Now itâ€™s time to migrate our database with our work use the code line `PHP artisan
